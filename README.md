### Overview

The **kazdoc** package includes a set of [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) templates that enable authoring of R related publications commonly produced within rstatscon. Available templates include:

- kaz_plain

<!--

The **rticles** package includes a set of [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) templates that enable authoring of R related journal and conference submissions, and creating e-books. Available templates include:

- [Tuftish e-book] e-books formatted based on the style of Edward R. Tufte and Richard Feynman

- [JSS](http://www.jstatsoft.org/) articles

- [R Journal](http://journal.r-project.org/) articles

- [useR](http://user2014.stat.ucla.edu/) conference abstracts

- [Public Library of Science (PLoS)](http://www.plos.org/) articles

- [CTeX](http://ctex.org) documents

- [ACS](http://pubs.acs.org) articles

Under the hood, LaTeX templates are used to ensure that documents conform precisely to submission standards. At the same time, composition and formatting can be done using lightweight [markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html) syntax, and R code and its output can be seamlessly included using [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/).

Using **rticles** has some prerequisites which are described below. You can get most of these pre-requisites automatically by installing the latest preview release of RStudio (instructions for using **rticles** without RStudio are also provided).
